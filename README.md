# Flappy-Santa
A program based on flappy bird. The game over message starts
before the game, just press the new game button. Press space
to jump. The game does not currently keep track of score.

Compiling:
There should already be up-to-date class files and a possibly 
out-of-date zip folder with a runnable jar in the bin folder.
For now, if you want to compile from source google how to do
it. Eventually I will create an ant build.
