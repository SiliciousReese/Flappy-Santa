# Flappy-Santa
A program based on flappy bird. The game over message starts
before the game, just press the new game button. Press space
to jump. The game does not currently keep track of score.

Running:
A runnable jar is located in the build directory, so from
this directory just execute that jar. This can be done in
a command prompt by executing this command from the 
Flappy-Santa directory.

java -jar build/Flappy-Santa-beta.jar

Eventually, I will create a build file to make compiling
from source easy, but until then the only way is to 
recompile each .java file in the src directory and run the
flappySanta.FlappySanta class from a directory that has
the res folder and its contents.
